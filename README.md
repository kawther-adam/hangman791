Introduction
This Hangman Game is a simple text-based implementation where players try to guess a word by suggesting letters. The game is implemented in Python and features a Hangman class with methods for checking guesses, asking for user input, and playing the game.

Features
Word Selection: The game randomly selects a word from a provided list.
Guess Checking: The check_guess method validates user guesses, updates the guessed word, and tracks the number of remaining letters.
User Input: The ask_for_input method handles user input, checks for validity, and calls the check_guess method.
Game Logic: The play_game function manages the overall game logic, handling lives, checking for a win or loss, and calling the appropriate methods.
How to Play
Initialize the Game: Import the Hangman class and create an instance by passing a list of words.

python
Copy code
word_list = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange', 'grape', 'watermelon']
hangman_game = Hangman(word_list)
Play the Game: Call the play_game function to start the game.

python
Copy code
play_game(word_list)
Guess Letters: Enter a single alphabetical character when prompted to guess a letter.

Win or Lose: The game continues until the player wins by guessing the word or loses all lives.

Dependencies
Python 3.x
Example
python
Copy code
# Import the Hangman class
from hangman import Hangman

# List of words for the game
word_list = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange', 'grape', 'kiwi']

# Create an instance of the Hangman class
hangman_game = Hangman(word_list)

# Play the game
hangman_game.play_game()
Customization
You can customize the game by modifying the word list or adjusting the initial number of lives. Additionally, you can extend the word list or implement additional features as needed.

Feel free to explore and enhance the game according to your preferences!

Note: Ensure that the Hangman class implementation is available in your project or module before running the game.
